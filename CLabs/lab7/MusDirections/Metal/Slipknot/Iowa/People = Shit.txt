Here we go again, motherfucker
Come on down, and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't feel anything
It isn't like I want to sift through the decay
I feel like a wound, like I got a fuckin'
Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead
One more time, motherfucker
Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands, and I
Don't know why, I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business
Whose life is it?
Get it? see it?
Feel it? eat it?
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I want to leave without a trace
'Cause I don't want to die in this place
People = shit, people = shit
People = shit, people = shit
People = shit (what cha gonna do?)
People = shit ('cause I am not afraid of you)
People = shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
People = shit
It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion, I'm sittin' at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be
Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it
Stop your bitchin' and fight your way through it
I'm, not, like, you, I, just, fuck, up
C'mon motherfucker, everybody has to die
C'mon motherfucker, everybody has to die
People = shit, people = shit
People = shit, people = shit
People = shit (what cha gonna do?)
People = shit ('cause I am not afraid of you)
People = shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
People = shit
People = shit, people = shit
People = shit, people = shit
People = shit (what cha gonna do?)
People = shit ('cause I am not afraid of you)
People = shit (I'm everything you'll never be) people = shit
