I'm a popstar threat and I'm not dead yet
Got a super dred bet with an angel drug head
Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
I'm supersonic, its pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities its all I want to be
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If your 555, I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this and I bleed for you
Still you look at my face like I'm somebody new
Toy nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine because your made of
Everything-I'm-not
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If your 555, I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
Thirty seconds, sixteen, eight, four, lemme tell you why
I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest
They're listening, clamoring
All the money in the world can't buy me
Go ahead, lie to me
Tell me again how you're tortured
I want to know how you fallowed your orders so well
Your full of shit
You had a dream, but this ain't it
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If your 555, I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
