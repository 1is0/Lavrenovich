Zero and zero is nothing but zero
Cancer and people conspire together
Running and running and going forever
Collected and sampled, starving for zero
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Minus the inside and minus the circle
Inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel
Wherein and herein, between us and near us
Zero and zero is nothing but zero
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
