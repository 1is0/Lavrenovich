Since day one I've been crass and far beyond.
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry...
Before you judge me, take a look at yourself.
Condescending, outlivin' in a lie.
Despite all the pain in my heart grinding through
It ain't due that you hate that I hate what you do
Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
A backstabbing motherfucker to the bone is what you are
And everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn.
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7
You look down to me to see the scum of the earth to be.
Fuck you, that's me, vile and obscene.
I ain't happy about it but at least I don't judge and decree
To be better than another human being.
And everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn.
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7
Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
Hey, would somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?
And everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn.
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7
"Death?
What do you all know about death?"
