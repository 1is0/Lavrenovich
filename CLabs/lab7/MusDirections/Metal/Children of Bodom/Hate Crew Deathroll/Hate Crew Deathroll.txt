Come on!
Hey!
Don't tell us what you want
'Cause we don't give a fuck about you and your kind
You!
You better take a step back where ever the fuck you came from
No!
You ain't one of us and to be a tag along you're too ugly and blunt
Why?
Is it do hard to get that we don't need you, stupid cunt!
If you don't know how to resent one another, to gain the new way
Of power, it'll get in to the point where no one gives a fuck what
You may think of us or what you may not
Stop!
Are you ever gonna stop tryin' to be on the way that we wanna go?
Fuck!
It's pissing the fuck out of us
When you don't understand the word "no"!
Now, you're tellin' that you'll win
The war that's only battled cuz you're
Too dumb to die
That's right!
You can take your war and shove it up your ass
Then close your eyes and say goodbye
If you don't know how to resent one another, to gain the new way
Of power, it'll get in to the point where no one gives a fuck what
You may think of us or what you may not
We're the Hate Crew, we stand and we won't fall
We're all for none and none for all
Fuck You!
We'll fight 'til the last hit
And we sure as hell aint taking no shit!
Fuck you!
