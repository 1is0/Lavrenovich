Let's go!
That's it, where to go?
Should I tell you where I wanna go?
We'll die there be motherfucking there broad away to be
All wilted way, I'll show you the place where I wanna die
We're gonna die in pain
Don't hurt my eyes, I feel the flame
Sun's going down (...sun's going down)
Moon's rising high (...moon's rising high)
We'll pay you Bodom beach terror
Late night you party until it's light
While pointing at the sky
Wash your hands in the lake of your blood
Just before you die
Bodom beach terror!
Go go!
To the place where you really wanna be, wanna go
From the dark away to hit lights, to hit that human light
One minute shape to hit time where you gonna go
I bet you're gonna hit ya to tear you down to a place you've never seen
Late night you party until it's light
While pointing at the sky
Wash your hands in the lake of your blood
Just before you die
Bodom beach terror!
