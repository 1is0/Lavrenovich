I hear the footsteps going by
Watching myself slowly die
Sharp pains impaling through my heart
Slowly tearing me apart
One minute you're an angel fallen from grace
Next, the fist that I hate
Pick me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss
Then rips out my heart to show me, how black it is
No
You're no good
It feels so cold
Yet I won't turn back
I'll die alone
I hear the footsteps walking by
Watching myself slowly die
Sharp pains impaling through my heart
Slowly tearing me apart
When you appear as an angel
Knocking me down, looking my way
Could you ever kill the pain in my heart?
Even though they say angels don't kill
No
You're no good
It feels so cold
Yet I won't turn back
I'll die alone
No (No)
You're no good
It feels so cold
Yet I won't turn back
I'll die alone
