We hear a prayer for the brighter morrow
It's hard to take thru all the laughter
We don't believe in tomorrow
It's just another morning after
We take a stand and we're standing tall
But only three of us crawl away
Never get old nor would we fall
But only two of us saw yesterday
I never thought it would get this far, oh no
Wherever you are, I won't follow
And when the candles slowly die
I will say my last goodbye
I need you far away from me
I want you closer to me
I need you far away from me
I want you closer to me
Don't bother trying to save us
We don't need your prayers
Because we were the afflicted
And none of us walked away
I need you far away from me
I want you closer to me
I need you far away from me
I want you closer to me
