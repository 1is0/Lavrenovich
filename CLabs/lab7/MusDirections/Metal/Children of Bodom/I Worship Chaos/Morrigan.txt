Holding the key to my darkened past
She's spinning with voices lost in past
The memory too disturbed
She's a story that'll never end
You're a two studded chain, a tear in my soul
She'll fly away with me when all said and done
But now she's gone
I don't believe in faith
The art of finding love
Refuse to let this cut me deep
Now to make her pay
Left to feel so numb
Yes, you may cut me again
But I mark these words with a blade
That I'll find you once again, Morrigan!
She's the coming of my demise
In every way, seen her alluring disguise
A six-foot tall bloody, jet-black scythe
Is all that's with me with the things I've done
Because she's gone
I don't believe in faith
The art of finding love
Refuse to let this cut me deep
Now to make her pay
Left to feel so numb
Yes, you may cut me again
But I mark these words with a blade
That I'll find you once again, Morrigan!
I ain't gonna leave from the post, so stay
On the way, get away from the twilight's scream
I refuse to let this cut me deep
I refuse to let this cut me deep!
I don't believe in faith
The art of finding love
Refuse to let this cut me deep
Now to make her pay
Left to feel so numb
Yes, you may cut me again
But I mark these words with a blade
That I'll find you once again, Morrigan!
