No peace of mind from quietude
Haunting nightmares follow thru
The panic that lingers in my eye
'Til I rip shit up, make angels cry
Contort the silence sighing faintly
My dark twisted secrets gravely
Every night's the same the world is sleeping
Yet my demons keep come creepin'
Thru the cracks of my shattered mind
So I stir up the chaos one more time
Mayhem, wrath I call thee mine
And both the sun and moon will shine
End of times, just kill the quietude
Hear my cries, and start the countdown
Bury my crimes, somewhere deep within
It's not that complicated
Simply I just worship chaos
Turmoil, terror I now conjure
The hell in my head please do conquer
So I throw down kickin' and screaming
Lie flat on the ground discarded and bleeding
But the noise is gone that's why
I stir up the chaos one more time
End of times, just kill the quietude
Hear my cries, and start the countdown
Bury my crimes, somewhere deep within
It's not that complicated
Simply I just worship chaos
