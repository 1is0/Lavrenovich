Open your eyes, what have you done?
I've been back, forth stuck yet spun
Too keyed to lie still, too tired to run
I can't believe it's come to this
It's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
Bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
Forever is a long time that I won't miss
Too tired to run it's getting late
Make up your mind
I was never your kind
This is gonna hurt me black 'n' blue
But don't you think that no one measures up to you
I cant believe it's come to this
It's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
Bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
Forever is a long time I won't miss
Feel the hate we're breeding
Fear the lives we're leading
Cry while you watch me bleeding
The blood I have been spilling
Love we keep on killing
Was supposed to be for something
Guess it was all for nothing
I cant believe it's come to this
It's safe to say ignorance is bliss
Bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
Do you feel the hate we're breeding
Fear the lives we're leading
Cry while you watch me bleeding
Cry while you watch me bleeding
