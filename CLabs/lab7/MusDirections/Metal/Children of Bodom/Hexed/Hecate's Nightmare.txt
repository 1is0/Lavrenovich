We never meant to let you down
But it all just goes to show
We keep on dancing though we know
It's the same old song of woe
Two torches light up the way
As they beckon from below
To the groves of willows where
The seeds of hate we sow
Lost souls hover over the crossroads
Crying out your name
If the desire is do or die
When all else has failed
Calling upon you is a game
Never lost or never prevailed
Lost souls hover over the crossroads
At rise of the new moon
When the gates slowly open wide
The hinges creak their tune
We're like Hecate's nightmare
Three shots from you and none to spare
Should've been more watchful
Calling out your name in vain
We never saw your pain
Hecate's nightmare
Unaware of the damage beyond repair
We're like Hecate's nightmare
Three shots from you and none to spare
Nightmare unaware
Of the damage beyond repair
Gates close in the light of the moon
And the hinges creak their tune
We have become...
Hecate's nightmare unaware
Of the damage beyond repair
Hecate's nightmare
Three shots from you and none to spare
Nightmare unaware
Of the damage beyond repair
Should've been more watchful
Calling out your name in vain
We never saw your pain
Hecate's nightmare unaware
Of the damage beyond repair
