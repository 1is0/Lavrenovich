[Verse 1]
Flashback from the night before
Was it the other day? I couldn't say
It's all coming in pieces
But before you know they just fade away
God damn! What did I hear, what'd I do?
Where did I go and how'd I get here?
I know I'm too far gone
A deadbeat, a travesty
So what's my next strategy?

[Verse 2]
Fuck me, there's blood on my hands
That's nothing new but now they're shaking too
Everything's soaked in sweat
Here comes the "forgive and forget"
Who should I forgive? Forget that plan
I really don't give a damn
I just need my fix, I'm dying
So break out the bottle and stop crying

[Chorus]
And the calm washes over
My soul drying my tears
Under the grass and clover
A new sense of hope appears

[Bridge]
Choking
Breathing exhaust
Hard to keep an even keel
Shot
Boiling mercury
It burns so bad yet I can't feel

[Bridge]
Choking
Breathing exhaust
Hard to keep an even keel
Shot
Boiling mercury
It burns so bad yet I can't feel
Walking
In a minefield
Hard to keep my eyes peeled
Shot
To Hell and fried
No Heaven evermore denied

[Chorus]
And the calm washes over
My soul drying my tears
Under the grass and clover
A new sense of hope appears
