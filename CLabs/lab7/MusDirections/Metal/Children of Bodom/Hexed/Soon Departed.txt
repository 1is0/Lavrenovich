[Verse 1]
When your hands have been tied
From front, back and from side to side
It's hard to see the shape of things to come
And the past becomes undone
No stars aligned to lead the blind
When your future is already declined

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying, discarded
Dying, soon departed

[Chorus]
Another morning, it’s hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away

[Verse 2]
If that is the life you choose
No circumstance can excuse
Why you run when you've passed
A dead end sign at long last
The days are numbered you swear
So you can start the countdown for all I care
Keep on telling yourself there's nothing left to do
Your story’s weak and so are you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying, discarded
Dying, soon departed

[Chorus]
Another morning, it's hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Another morning, it's hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away
