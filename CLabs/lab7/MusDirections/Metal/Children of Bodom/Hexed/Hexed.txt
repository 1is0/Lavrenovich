[Verse 1]
Sometimes my pain is so damn elaborate
That I can taste the blood in my tears, trying to forget
They haunt me, taunt me
The dreams that are nothing but a cruel joke on me
I'll ride 'em out, yet I'm taut in actuality

[Chorus]
Hexed
Turned into a casualty
Hexed
A blessing or a travesty?

[Post-Chorus]
Kill me once, who's to blame?
Kill me twice, I'm yours to claim
Curse me once, shame on you
Hex me twice, shame on me

[Verse 2]
If spirits could be visible, not just a fallacy
Your hex would be tangible but in reality
They haunt me, taunt me
Am I just a victim of my insanity?
A final chapter in a tale that ends in tragedy?

[Chorus]
Hexed
Turned into a casualty
Hexed
A blessing or a travesty?
Hexed
Demon's within
Hexed
Crawling under my skin

[Post-Chorus]
Kill me once, who's to blame?
Kill me twice, I'm yours to claim
Curse me once, shame on you
Hex me twice, shame on me

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Hexed
Turned into a casualty
Hexed
A blessing or a travesty?
Hexed
Demon's within
Hexed
Crawling under my skin

[Outro]
Hexed
Hexed
Hexed
Hexed
Hexed
Hexed
