Oh Devon
Won't go to Heaven
She's just another lost soul, about to be mine again
Leave her
We will receive her
It is beyond your control
Will you ever meet again.
Devon
One of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole.
As a little child,
She was taken
And then forsaken
You will remember it all
Let it blow your mind again.
Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal
Give your soul to me
For eternity
Release your life
To begin another time with her
End your grief with me
There's another way
Release your life
Take your place inside the fire with her
Sever
Now and forever
You're just another lost soul about to be mine again
See her, you'll never free her
You must surrender it all
In your life to meet again
Fire
All you desire
As she begins to turn cold and run out of time
You will shiver
Till you deliver
You will remember it all
Let it blow your mind again
Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal
Give your soul to me
For eternity
Release your life
To begin another time with her
End your grief with me
There's another way
Release your life
Take your place inside the fire with her.
Give your soul to me
For eternity
Release your life
To begin another time with her
End your grief with me
There's another way
Release your life
Take your place inside the fire with her
Devon
Among the livin'
Who had been rendered unwhole
As a little child
She was taken,
And then forsaken
You will remember it all
Let it blow your mind again.
