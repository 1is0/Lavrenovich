Fuckin' lil' homies
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Lil' homies
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Just pay attention
Here's a story bout my lil' homies, straight thuggin'
Lil' bad young mothafuckers, gotta love him
You could catch him in his G ride, touchin' his glock
Screamin outlaw bustin' on my enemy's block
Educated on these cold streets
Gettin money makin' dummies out the police, ain't no peace
For an adolescent nigga to rap, so be a thinker
Bud smokin' twenty-four seven, everyday drinker
Got my diploma but I never learned shit in school
Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder fool
Always the young niggaz gettin' in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch
Bustin' on paper thin motherfuckers
Drinkin gin 'fore youu get to sinnin' on them busters
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police, 'cause lil' niggaz on the street
(My fuckin' lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police, 'cause lil' niggaz on the street
(My fuckin' lil' homies)
I remember, when you was just a lil' G
Flirting with death, playin' Russian Roulette, screamin', "Kill me"
"Hey there young nigga, what you smokin' on?"
Mad at the world 'cause you came from a broken home
Love to squad plus your mob is sick
A bunch of adolescent niggaz spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga if ya die let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watchin' as your Mother cries?
Will all your homies ride?
Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggaz on a mission to compete
Gettin' G's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'
And loaded up on the whole front row
Try to tell him but he act like he don't know
Pull out his pistol and show me, my lil' homie
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police, 'cause lil' niggaz on the street
(My fuckin' lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police, 'cause lil' niggaz on the street
(My fuckin' lil' homies)
First to bomb, sixteen on death row
Bustin' on them phony motherfuckers 'cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew I was a nut case, quick to blast
Livin' underage, but he'll blaze on yo' bitch ass
Is there a Heaven for a G?
And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streets ain't no peace, shell-shocked souls
Makin' money off of crack sales, young black males
Unable to change 'cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows, the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K Kastro
Big mouth Hussein, call them Outlawz
Tellin the world to be equipped
When these young motherfuckers rip shit, they don't quit
Drew down on me, pull a pound on me
Bust like he didn't know me, my lil' homies
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police, 'cause lil' niggaz on the street
(My fuckin' lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police, 'cause lil' niggaz on the street
(My fuckin' lil' homies)
