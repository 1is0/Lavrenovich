Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..
The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob n****z love to act up
The first to bomb we rob n****z
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
N****z get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty gla** of Hennesey
Talkin to a n**** on a tight leash
Screamin "F*** the police, " as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin n**** unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life I will be (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead (close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin (close your eyes)
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a b****, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder, than hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life I will be (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead (close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out, the n****z came out boom!
Who want to see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin n****z in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my n****z facin sixty years, sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes, tryin to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death n****
Take a breath come be the last one left n****, it's real now
Villain to fantasize, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life I will be (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead (close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier
This go out to Cato, Mental
All the n****z that pa**ed away
To Geronimo ? all the down a** riders
All the n****z that put it down, all the soldiers
All the n****z that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the n****z that pa**ed on
All the n****z with ambition and money in they heart
All the n****z that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They want to see us dead
They got pictures of a n**** head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, s***
Them n****z'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols c***ed
Run the whole motherf***in' block, f*** the cops!
The police? We run these streets n****
Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!
These n****z can't see me, half the world want to be me
Multi-millionaire, s***, it ain't fair
But n****, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
